##Question Set ##

1. What happens to Platelets, RBCs and the WBCs during n (six-day) periods when both the Creatinine and Albumin contents increased significantly?
(Increased Significantly = greater than 2% on a day to day basis)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Steps:
Get data for Creatinine
Get data for Albumin
Filter Creatinine > 0
Filter Albumin > 0
Filter Creatinine AND Albumin > 0 (intersection)

For the dates found above, Capture Platelets, RBCs and WBCs data and check what happens to each of the three above over the next n (=6) days on those particular dates.
Eg, Albumin and Creatinine both increased significantly (>2%) on the following dates:
02-OCT-2012, 31-DEC-2012, 14-FEB-2015

So, we have to get the data for the 3 blood contents above and check the average count, statistics for the n (=6) days after the 3 dates mentioned above.

Statistics required:
Increase count (days):
Decrease count (days):
Average % increase:
Average % decrease:
Mean, Median, Mode, Quantiles.
P-values, R2 - Values and so on as relevant.
